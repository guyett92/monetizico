# Exchange

Exchange is a community-focused e-comm marketplace. We are guided by four key principes:

1. Safety
2. Simplicity
3. Efficiency
4. User-Friendliness

Our hope is that users can feel comfortable buying and selling the things they want and the things they need on our site.

## Technologies Used
Exchange was built with the following technologies:

* HTML, CSS, Python
* Django
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg)

## User Stories
When users first arrive at our site, they can browse postings to see if there are any items they may like to purchase. They can also search for items they may be interested in purchasing in two ways: using our search bar, they can search for products by name; or, using our dropdown menu, they can search for products by category.

If a user finds something they would like to purchase, or if a user would like to post something for someone else to purchase, they will need to create an account and then log in.

For users looking to purchase an item, once they've logged in they can find the item they would like to buy and go through our seamless checkout process.

For users to looking to post something for sale, they can use the dropdown menu on the top of their screen to create a product and then post that product for other users to search for. Users can also edit the products they've created or the posts they've made advertising those products.

All users can reach out to the Exchange team via email using our contact page.

## Future Plans

We have many plans for improvements to this initial project. On a small scale, we want to add OAuth via Google to our current method for authenticating and authorizing users. We would also like to send emails automatically to users upon registration. There are also some changes to the front end that we would like to make, including using modals for our Edit Post functionality.

On a larger scale, we want to allow users to upload multiple photos of products they would like to sell, rather than just one. We also hope to add a live chat feature so that users can speak with a member of the Exchange team in real time.
